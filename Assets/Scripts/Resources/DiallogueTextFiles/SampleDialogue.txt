[NAME=???]Hello!

Welcome to the world of Game Development!

[NAME=Michael]My name is Michael, and this is NPC Dialogue.

A pretty easy way to handle linear dialogue is with text files.

Here you can edit what is being said without having to edit every line in Unity.

Trust me, it can get annoying very quickly having to click on textboxes and such.

Of course, if you wanted nonlinear dialogue, you would need a way to implement player choice, a way to record it, and a way to navigate a file or two.
